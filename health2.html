              <p>  S.G. Policy
The S.G. insurance policy is the abbreviation of the Lloyd S.G. standard policy. It was the first annex of the Maritime Insurance Act passed by the British Parliament in 1906 and became the UK's statutory maritime standard insurance policy. As the UK has long dominated the maritime insurance industry, S.G. insurance policies have had an extraordinary impact on the insurance industry worldwide. However, due to the fact that the insurance policy is intended to cover the ship and the goods together as an insurance object, and it completely deviates from the status quo of the modern shipping industry, it was repealed on April 1, 1983.<br>
ITC policy
The Ship Scheduled Insurance Policy Form, officially used by the London Insurer Association on October 1, 1983, replaced the previous S.G. Policy with the ICC Policy.<br>
ICC policy
The London Insurers Association established on January 1, 1982, an insurance policy for the carriage of goods by sea that began on March 31, 1983. The ICC policy replaced the earlier S.G. policy with the ITC policy.
Insurance policy<br>
The “big policy” refers to the formal insurance policy, also referred to as the “policy policy”, which corresponds to the small policy. It is the most formal form of insurance document. It is also the most widely used type of insurance document in international trade. It is also the official document for establishing an insurance contract between an insurer and an insured person.
Small policy<br>
Small insurance policy is the abbreviation of insurance certificate, also known as insurance article. The insurance certificate is issued by the insurer to the insured, indicating that it has accepted the proof of its insurance, a simplified insurance policy. The insurance certificate does not contain the insurance policy on the back of the policy. The remaining contents are exactly the same as the policy. All items not listed on the insurance certificate are subject to the same major policy. The legal effect of a small policy is the same as that of a large policy, but it cannot be used as a basis for lawsuits against insurers, and therefore it is not used in the international market. In practice, a small policy is generally issued by an insurer and may also be issued by an insurance broker as an insurance policy on behalf of an insurance agent. <br>
Reservation Policy
An insurance policy is an insurance policy issued by an insurer or insurance broker in the form of an underwriting policy, which covers the goods transport insurance policy that is exported by the insured in a certain period of time and exported in Group C terms or in Group F terms. It specifies the scope of insurance goods, insurance coverage, insurance rates, the maximum amount of insurance for each shipment of goods, and the calculation of insurance premiums. All goods subject to a pre-arranged insurance policy will automatically be issued according to the underwriting conditions on the pre-arrangement insurance policy once the insurance policy is issued. However, the insurer is required to issue a shipping notice to the insurer for the transportation of each shipment, that is, each batch The insurer informs the insurer of the name, quantity, insured amount, type and name of the transportation vehicle, starting point of departure, departure date, departure date, etc., and the insurer issues a formal insurance document accordingly.
